CSRF Token:
What is a CSRF Token?
A CSRF token (Cross-Site Request Forgery token) is a security feature used in web applications to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

📌 Why is it Important?
Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
Ensures that form submissions or API requests come from a legitimate user session.
Without a valid CSRF token, the server rejects requests (often returning HTTP 419 or 403 errors).
🚀 Handling CSRF Token in JMeter (Login Requests)
If your website has CSRF protection, JMeter must extract and send the CSRF token with each request.

✅ Steps to Handle CSRF in JMeter
1️⃣ Extract CSRF Token from the Login Page
2️⃣ Pass the CSRF Token in the Login Request

1️⃣ Extract CSRF Token Using "Regular Expression Extractor"
Open JMeter
Go to Your Login Request (GET Request)
This is where the page returns the CSRF token in the response.
Add "Regular Expression Extractor"
Right-click Login Request → Add → Post Processors → Regular Expression Extractor
Configure the Extractor:
Field to check → Body (default)
Regular Expression → _token" value="(.+?)"
Template → $1$
Match No. → 1
Name of created variable → CSRF_TOKEN
2️⃣ Use Extracted CSRF Token in Login Request
Go to Your Login Request (POST Request)
Add a "Parameter" in the HTTP Request
Name → _token
Value → ${CSRF_TOKEN}
